Audio Visualizer Documentation

Audio Effect nodes added are the treble and bass nodes.

The Sprite class is a rotating spiral visual that rotates as the audio plays. There are three of those spirals in total on the canvas.

The app data has the title of the application, an array of tracks that includes their name and url, and an array of 3 sprites and some their data (x coordinate, y coordinate, and color).

I would give myself a 5% as there are not many substantial changes from the AV HW. I altered the colors to make it a bit more pleasing to the eyes and rearranged how the bars are drawn, starting them from the center of the canvas.
